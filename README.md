Assignment 3

In this Assignment we completed two Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll  using Python.
The PyBank Financial Analysis script is designed to analyze financial records stored in a CSV file.
The script calculates key financial metrics, such as: 

    Total months
    Net total profits/losses
    Average change in profits/losses
    Greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
    Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)
    Results are printed to the console and exported to a text file (financial_analysis.txt) located in the PyBank/analysis folder.

The PyPoll Election Analysis script is designed to analyze election data stored in a CSV file. The 
script calculates key election metrics, such as:
    Total votes cast
    Percentage of votes each candidate won
    Election winner
    Results  are printed to the console and exported to a text
file (election_results.txt) located in the PyPoll/analysis folder.
